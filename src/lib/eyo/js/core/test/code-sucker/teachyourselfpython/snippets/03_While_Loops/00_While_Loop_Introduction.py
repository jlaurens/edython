""" Do not forget to indent the statements that are inside the while loop (to be repeated)
They must be repeated to the same level.
Use the Tab key to indent. (space bar can also be used)
When used like this the while loop is said to be 'counter-controlled'.
In this program, x is acting like a counter (going by 1 for each loop round)
